# Aces Library Development Progress

## 2026-01-16 - Phase 1: Foundation Setup COMPLETE

### What was done:
- Initialized Next.js 16 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, ESLint, and App Router
- Installed all core dependencies:
  - @supabase/supabase-js & @supabase/ssr for database/auth
  - framer-motion for animations
  - @dnd-kit/core & @dnd-kit/sortable for drag-and-drop
  - zustand for state management
  - react-hot-toast for notifications
  - sharp for image optimization
- Set up testing infrastructure with Vitest + React Testing Library
- Configured Tailwind CSS v4 with Japanese listening room theme:
  - Wood tones palette (50-900 shades, primary #B59A76)
  - Warm accent palette (#FF9D57)
  - Analog equipment grays (#6B6B5E)
  - Dark mode support
  - Custom .btn-vintage and .card-vinyl utility classes
  - Turntable rotation and VU meter animations
- Created project directory structure following PRD spec:
  - src/app/(auth), (dashboard), (public), api routes
  - src/components/collection, wishlist, now-playing, gallery, ui, shared, layout
  - src/lib/supabase, spotify, hooks, store, types
  - supabase/migrations
- Created TypeScript type definitions for all database entities
- Created basic landing page with vinyl-themed design
- Set up .env.example with all required environment variables
- Added npm scripts: typecheck, test, test:watch

### Verification:
- `pnpm typecheck` - PASSES
- `pnpm test` - PASSES (3 tests)
- `pnpm build` - PASSES

### Next steps (Phase 2 - Supabase Setup):
1. Create Supabase project via dashboard
2. Run database migrations for all 5 tables (profiles, vinyls, wishlist_items, now_playing, spotify_tokens)
3. Set up indexes on owner_id, artist, genre, created_at
4. Enable RLS policies on all tables
5. Create storage buckets (vinyl-covers, vinyl-photos, audio-clips, wishlist-images)
6. Create Supabase client helpers (src/lib/supabase/client.ts, server.ts)
7. Generate TypeScript types from Supabase

### Notes for next developer:
- Project uses Tailwind CSS v4 which uses @theme blocks in CSS instead of tailwind.config.ts
- Use pnpm as the package manager
- The src/ directory structure is used (not root-level app/)
- Custom colors are defined in globals.css and can be used as classes like `bg-wood-500`, `text-analog-600`, etc.
- Vintage button style is available as `.btn-vintage` class
- Card hover effects are available as `.card-vinyl` class
